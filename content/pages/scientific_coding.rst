Scientific coding workshop
==========================

:date: 2014-10-07 12:49

The idea is to organize a series of meeting and get familiar with modern
scientific libraries and tools. In the beginning we can go trough `the materials
provided by Software Carpentry`__.

Once we get familiar with basic topics (for example, array operations, storage,
plotting). We can have a look to specific problems from linguistics, biology,
physics or any other field.

Anyone interested in the subject is very welcome to come! Please contact
Dmitrijs Milajevs <d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk> if you have any question.

First meeting: Analyzing Patient Data with Python
=================================================

:host: `Dmitrijs (Dima) Milajevs <d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk>`_
:difficulty: easy

Follow the Software Carpentry lesson `Analyzing Patient Data`__. The tutorial
goes trough basic data analysis steps: read the data, process it and present
(plot) the result. In addition to the tutorial, we can have a look into `IPython
Notebook`_.

.. _`Ipython Notebook`: http://ipython.org/notebook.html

Please `install Python and NumPy <http://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html>`_
before the meeting! It might be tricky to get the packages, contact Dima, if you
have any problems.

Meeting idea: Estimate n-gram probabilities from the BNC
========================================================

:host: `Dmitrijs (Dima) Milajevs <d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk>`_
:difficulty: intermediate

After the `first meeting of the NLP seminar <http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~dm303/pages/nlp-seminar.html#introduction-to-n-gram-models-oct-6>`_ there was an idea to replicate Table 6.3 in [statistical-nlp]_.

During this meeting we can estimate the n-gram probabilities using MLE from the
BNC corpus. To make things more interesting (and faster) the n-grams counts can
be stored as `Pandas DataFrames`__.
