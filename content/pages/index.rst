Our aim is to build community of passionate people where they share and implement
their ideas. Our main activities consist of but not limited to the following:

Taster Sessions
===============

Give an introduction to the new technologies that are not yet adopted by the
industry. For example, `Hacklang <http://hacklang.org/>`__, `PostgreSQL 9.4
hstore`__ and anything else you can find.

Workshops
=========

Organize workshops on computing related topics, such as "Introduction to version
control".

Hackathons
==========

Being equipped with leading edge knowledge we test it by organizing programming
sessions over a weekend to implement a cool idea. But, frankly, we are just
looking for beer and pizza.

Competitions
============

Prepare ourselves to programming competitions by studying data structures and
algorithms. Organize such competition to figure out the smartest programmer.

Project Acceleration
=====================

Give any kind of help to implement an idea. Provide technical help.

Career Guidance
===============

While it's all about fun, the final goal is to become a super star developer and
be competitive after the graduation. On  our side, we link students with
companies and provide legal help to achieve this.
