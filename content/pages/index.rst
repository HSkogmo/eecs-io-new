Our aim is to build a community where knowledge is shared and ideas are
implemented. To achieve it we organize the following:

Blog
====

.. It's ugly, but i don't really know how to refer to arhives.html

Share opinionated articles on technical topics on `our blog </archives.html>`__.
If you know something special write an article about it. Check the blog
regularly, as there are articles written by your peers who had to solve the same
problems as you do. And remember, the best way to learn something is to explain
it so somebody else.

Taster Sessions
===============

Give an introduction to new technologies that are not yet adopted by the
industry. For example, `Hacklang <http://hacklang.org/>`__, `PostgreSQL 9.4
hstore`__ and anything else you can find promising.

Workshops
=========

Organize workshops on topics related to computing, such as `Introduction to
version control`__.

Hackathons
==========

Being equipped with leading edge knowledge we test it by organizing programming
sessions over a weekend to implement a cool idea. Frankly, we just look for beer
and pizza.

Competitions
============

Prepare ourselves for `programming competitions`__ by studying data structures and
algorithms. Organize such competition to figure out the smartest programmer.

Project Acceleration
=====================

Give any kind of help so you could implement `your idea`__.

Career Guidance
===============

Link students with companies. Even a super star developer needs to find a place
to work after the graduation!
