The Computing Society was established in 2014 as a natural expansion of
Queen Mary's Python Club. Today the society is dedicated to benefit the students
and widen their academic horizon by organising social and educational events.
Technology excites us, and we want to create a community that cultivates this by
having an entertaining and interesting environment between passionate students.

The Society embodies the curiosity of all our members. Together we explore and
tinker with all things intriguing ranging from assembly languages to interface
design. With a growing array of technologies we can discover and create new
things every day.

Join us, and share our passion.
