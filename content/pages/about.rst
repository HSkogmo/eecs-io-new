The society is dedicated to benefit the students and widen their academic
horizon by organising social and educational events. Technology excites us, and
we want to create a community that cultivates this by having an entertaining and
interesting environment between passionate students.

The Society embodies the curiosity of all our members. Together we explore and
tinker with all things intriguing ranging from assembly languages to interface
design. With a growing array of technologies we can discover and create new
things every day.

`Join us <http://www.qmsu.org/groups/ESociety/>`__, and share our passion.
