There are several events on the radar that not only give you loads of
knowledge, but also give you some money.

PyData in London
----------------

PyData_ is a conference dedicated to the scientific tools in Python. London is
the first city outside the U.S. that hosts the conference on February 21 - 23.

This time several `diversity scholarships`_ are offered. Here is the
announcement from the conference page:

    One of the goals of PyData is to increase awareness and excitement around
    opportunities for women and underrepresented groups in software engineering.
    To increase diversity in scientific computing, our outreach programmes range
    from hosting workshops to introduce programming to young women, to encouraging
    diversity in speakers.

    For PyData London 2014, we are offering scholarship opportunities to women and
    those from other underrepresented groups who may otherwise be unable to attend
    the conference. Generous donations from the Python Software Foundation and
    NumFocus have made these efforts possible.

    To apply for a scholarship, please fill out our application_.

Go ahead and drop several lines!

Google Summer of Code worldwide
-------------------------------

In case you didn't hear about `Google Summer of Code`__, it is something like
a software engineering project, but first, you do something useful, second,
you get a lot of support from professional developers (so you are not alone
trying to configure SVN and NetBeans), and you get paid.

So far the program is in early stage, the list of accepted projects `will be
published on February 24`__. However, it's a good idea to go trough the
`project list of 2013`__ to get an idea of possible projects and good
applications.
