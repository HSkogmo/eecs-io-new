The EECS society will be making its 3rd annual visit on the **29th of November**
to Bletchley park (home of the code breakers) and the national museum of
computing, where the first programmable computer (Colossus) was renovated.

Bletchley park is also a war museum and a part of British heritage so well worth
a visit. The school offers a big discount on the overall visit and is limited to
the coach size of 49 (so be quick!). The society does this trip every year as a
part remembrance to the war heroes of Bletchley and of course to the roots of
our discipline in EECS (birth place of the computer and that Colossus was made
by an Electronic Engineer).

If you want to join, send an email to epp-organisers@eecs.qmul.ac.uk.
