Undergraduate students take part in teams of 3, trying to solve around 10
problems using 1 computer in 5 hours, with no internet access. These
problems are solved by finding the most relevant and optimal algorithm for
a solution. Solutions are submitted to an automatic judge, that runs the
code, and compares the result with an official expected output.

This year, the contest has 3 sponsors: Google, Paypal, & EF
